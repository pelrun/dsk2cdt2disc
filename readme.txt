Many thanks to their authors - Magnus Lind et al, arnoldemu and cngsoft.

This tool lets you get a physical copy of a .dsk image, using your CPC and a tape cable.

Usage: dsk2cdt <input.dsk>

you will get side1.cdt, side2.cdt etc depending on the number of sides in the dsk.

Put a blank disc (or one you don't care about) into your CPC, then
|tape
run"

The loader will *not* wait or warn you about losing your disc contents!
